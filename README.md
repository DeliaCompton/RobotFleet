# RobotFleet

Created a HTML application that makes an API call to retrieve the robots in this fleet: https://60c8ed887dafc90017ffbd56.mockapi.io/robots
Clone this repository to a local folder
Open html file in your local browser

I really stuggled with trying to sort the list. I would like add a search bar, to filter through all the robots and attributes, and style the table more, in addition to actually getting it to sort in every column.
